      <description>Abstract
Frequently, k-nearest neighbors classification is applied with features chosen arbitrarily, while `k` is adjusted to improve the accuracy of the model. For this experiment, `k` is fixed. Using correlations with the strict acknowledgement that all features are continuous, a feature set with high correlation within itself is selection. Visual analysis using density and scatter plots show that these features also share distinct distributions and thusly make great candidates for k-nearest neighbors clustering.</description>
