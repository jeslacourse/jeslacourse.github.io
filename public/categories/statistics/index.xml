      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ll likely be revisiting this project in the future to see how my analysis has changed. With that said, I&amp;rsquo;m presenting this project as I did in 2016. So much has changed in the last four years. I&amp;rsquo;m excited to rework this project and pull in some fresh data. It should make for a very interesting before-and-after.

      <title>Feature Choice in Classification of Kernels</title>

      <description>Abstract
Frequently, k-nearest neighbors classification is applied with features chosen arbitrarily, while `k` is adjusted to improve the accuracy of the model. For this experiment, `k` is fixed. Using correlations with the strict acknowledgement that all features are continuous, a feature set with high correlation within itself is selection. Visual analysis using density and scatter plots show that these features also share distinct distributions and thusly make great candidates for k-nearest neighbors clustering.</description>

      <description>Side-by-Side Comparison of (a) Generic Plot and (b) Faceted Plots with Highlight
Visualizing Categorical Data What&amp;rsquo;s the most effective way to visualize comparisons between variable factors? How do you share a lot of information without muddying up your visualizations? There definitely isn&amp;rsquo;t one answer, but here&amp;rsquo;s one solution: faceted plots with gghighlight.
For sample data, I’m setting up two normal curves with offset sample means x̄ = ± 2. While we&amp;rsquo;re using two factors for simplicity, this method actual becomes more effective when the number of factors increases.</description>
