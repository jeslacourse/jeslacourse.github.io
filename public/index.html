  If quarantine has brought me one gift, my once three-hour commute is now three hours each day to build a portfolio and digress on some of the more interesting topics in statistics, machine learning, and computer science. This of course, comes at the expense of turning the dining room into my new office but the familial repercussions appear to be relatively minor.
Hi, I&rsquo;m [object Object].

  I&rsquo;ll likely be revisiting this project in the future to see how my analysis has changed. With that said, I&rsquo;m presenting this project as I did in 2016. So much has changed in the last four years. I&rsquo;m excited to rework this project and pull in some fresh data. It should make for a very interesting before-and-after.

  Abstract
Frequently, k-nearest neighbors classification is applied with features chosen arbitrarily, while `k` is adjusted to improve the accuracy of the model. For this experiment, `k` is fixed. Using correlations with the strict acknowledgement that all features are continuous, a feature set with high correlation within itself is selection. Visual analysis using density and scatter plots show that these features also share distinct distributions and thusly make great candidates for k-nearest neighbors clustering.

  The original post is a response to a class forum. This post is just a handy way to determine how the site will handle markdown language while also providing some interesting content.
This was originally part of a response to #151, but it should be good information for anyone trying to troubleshoot git version control. I&rsquo;ve pulled some of the specific troubleshooting out and added a bunch of detail on the common commands.

  Side-by-Side Comparison of (a) Generic Plot and (b) Faceted Plots with Highlight
Visualizing Categorical Data What&rsquo;s the most effective way to visualize comparisons between variable factors? How do you share a lot of information without muddying up your visualizations? There definitely isn&rsquo;t one answer, but here&rsquo;s one solution: faceted plots with gghighlight.
For sample data, I’m setting up two normal curves with offset sample means x̄ = ± 2. While we&rsquo;re using two factors for simplicity, this method actual becomes more effective when the number of factors increases.

  I&rsquo;m excited. It&rsquo;s been a long road trying to find the right platform to build on. Fortunately, hosting on GitHub Pages, along with the incredible development of the Jekyll-based Minimal Mistakes theme has made web-development a (relatively) seamless task for integrating my projects from GitHub. I&rsquo;ll post source code and repositories as reasonable. Some of the projects are University-based and don&rsquo;t change much year-to-year. In those cases, sorry kids. Check out the end result but we can&rsquo;t make it that easy for you.
