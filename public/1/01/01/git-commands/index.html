<p>This was originally part of a response to #151, but it should be good information for anyone trying to troubleshoot git version control. I&rsquo;ve pulled some of the specific troubleshooting out and added a bunch of detail on the common commands. My hope is that it gives you guys a kind of understanding of what git is doing in the background.</p>
<p>Pleeease be careful about just blindly typing in git commands. As safe as git version control is, you run a real risk of overwriting your files by just trying to <code>pull</code> simply when git asks you to.</p>
<h3 id="short-version">Short version:</h3>
<p><code>git clone url</code>: Asking the remote (online) repository to make a local (PC) copy</p>
<p><code>git pull</code>: Including or &ldquo;pulling down&rdquo; changes from the remote repository to your local</p>
<p><code>git status</code>: Looking at the differences between the remote and local. Awesome tool for troubleshooting.</p>
<p><code>git diff</code>: Shows changes between the remote file and the local</p>
<p><code>git add</code>: Prep stage getting ready to add new files that are local but you want to be remote. This is also where git starts tracking files if you&rsquo;ve heard that term before.</p>
<p><code>git commit</code>:  Takes the files to be updated to the remote repo, creates a &ldquo;timestamp of sorts&rdquo; and stages them to be included in the remote repo, i.e. you&rsquo;re committing the changes you&rsquo;ve made up to a certain point. For us, this is usually just one commit (when we complete the file).</p>
<p><code>git push</code>: Updates the remote repository</p>
<h3 id="a-bit-more-in-depth">A bit more in-depth</h3>
<p><strong>Git Pull</strong>
So let&rsquo;s talk real quick about what <code>git pull</code> does, especially considering if you&rsquo;re pushing your changes  you likely have a complete project that shouldn&rsquo;t be altered much. <code>git pull</code> is pulling remote (online) changes down to your local (PC) repository. Disclaimer, I use Git Bash console for my commands, so RStudio will be slightly different, but the commands are the same.  For this class, we don&rsquo;t really <code>pull</code> assignments as much since we&rsquo;re simply using <code>git clone url</code> to create a local copy. <del><code>git pull</code> is more effective in cases like #80 where there&rsquo;s been a revision.</del>[For revisions see : #153] Assuming you&rsquo;ve already cloned the file, <code>git pull</code> will &ldquo;pull down&rdquo; any changes made to the remote repository and include them in your local file.</p>
<p><strong>Git Status and Diff</strong>
But you&rsquo;ve been working on your files before the changes were made remotely, right? Now you have a high risk of merge conflicts. Try out <code>git status</code> to see what files have changed.</p>
<p>Mine looks like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with &#39;origin/master&#39;. # where your conflict is 
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use &#34;git add &lt;file&gt;...&#34; to update what will be committed)
  (use &#34;git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;...&#34; to discard changes in working directory)

        modified:   q1.Rmd
        modified:   q2.Rmd
        modified:   q3.Rmd

Untracked files:
  (use &#34;git add &lt;file&gt;...&#34; to include in what will be committed)

        .RData
        .Rhistory
        q1.html
        q2.html

no changes added to commit (use &#34;git add&#34; and/or &#34;git commit -a&#34;)
</code></pre><p>The first few lines are telling me that I&rsquo;m on the main branch (we won&rsquo;t talk about branches much here, so this won&rsquo;t change for the time being) and that my (local) branch, or copy of the repo, is up-to-date with the remote repository, called &lsquo;origin/master&rsquo;.</p>
<p>After that we start to see file status changes. I&rsquo;m currently working on <code>q3.Rmd</code>, and haven&rsquo;t pushed any changes yet, so it&rsquo;s intuitive that my modified files would be the three <code>*.Rmd</code> files.</p>
<p>If for some reason <code>status tells me that I'm </code>x commits behind master<code>I can look at the difference between my repo and the remote repo line-by-line with</code>git diff`.</p>

</code></pre><p>Here, <code>a/q1.Rmd</code> <code>b/q1.Rmd</code> are my remote and local files being compared, respectively. Values between the <code>@</code> symbols are line references and the <code>+</code> is a line, an author tag at the start of assignment 1,  I added to the start of the file. Intuitively, you can also have <code>-</code> changes for lines deleted. <code>git diff</code> is especially handy when you are working in a team and the remote repo is changing while you&rsquo;re working locally.</p>
<p><strong>Git Add, Commit and Push</strong> 
The local repository doesn&rsquo;t have a copy of <code>q1.html</code> or <code>q2.html</code> so I&rsquo;ll tell bash &ldquo;Hey, when I push, I want to push these files, too&rdquo; with the command <code>git add q1.html q2.html</code> (and ultimately q3 as well).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve added my files, now I want to commit them, <code>git commit -m &quot;Complete Assignments&quot;</code>, where <code>-m</code> is called a flag saying &ldquo;I want to include the message, &lsquo;Complete assignment&rsquo;&rdquo;.</p>
<p>From there, I can push my changes, <code>git push origin master</code>.</p>
<p>Once I push my changes, all five files (three <code>*.Rmd</code>s and two <code>*.htmls</code> will push to the local repository.</p>
<p><strong>So why are <code>git add</code>, <code>git commit</code>, and <code>git push</code> three different commands?</strong> 
It could be one right?</p>
<p>The first, I hope it&rsquo;s a bit intuitive as to why <code>git add</code> is it&rsquo;s own command. You don&rsquo;t necessarily want to add ALL the files in a folder to the remote repo. There is a command, use it wisely, to add all new files <code>git add .</code> Similarly, to add all changes, added and deleted files, etc. There&rsquo;s <code>git add -A</code> where dot and <code>-A</code> respectively are flags for &ldquo;all new&rdquo; and &ldquo;all&rdquo; changes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not the only one whose committed a file, gotten the message that it was successful, then&hellip; it&rsquo;s not there. It&rsquo;s not where it&rsquo;s supposed to be! Why isn&rsquo;t my file online? 
There&rsquo;s some nuance in the difference between <code>git commit</code> and <code>git push</code>. The way I think of it is that <code>git commit</code> is kind of like putting a bookmark in my book, while <code>git push</code> is talking about the latest changes (between this time and the last time I dropped a bookmark in my book) with a(n obviously Zoom) book club or something larger than myself. Does that make sense? <code>commit</code> logs changes locally, while <code>push</code> updates our remote repository with our changes.</p>
<p>For this class, we only <code>commit</code> and <code>push</code> once, usually. But when you&rsquo;re working on a larger project you can absolutely <code>commit</code> and <code>push</code> to a repo dozens or hundreds of times.</p>
<p>Edit: Formatting, added <code>git diff</code> information</p>
