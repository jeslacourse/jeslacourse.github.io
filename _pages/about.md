>If quarantine has brought me one gift, my once three-hour commute is now three hours each day to build a portfolio and digress on some of the more interesting topics in statistics, machine learning, and computer science. This of course, comes at the expense of turning the dining room into my new office but the  familial repercussions appear to be relatively minor. 

# About the Author

Hi, I'm `[object Object]`. 

Kidding. My name is Jessica LaCourse. My primary background is in Statistics and Data Science. I also hold extensive knowledge in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) as well as a professional background in Financial Accounting and Business Administration. Outside of professional work, my projects are oriented toward community action with emphasis on voter advocacy and community organization.



###  Educational Motivation
At my core, I'm fiercely dedicated to shedding light on community and environmental issues. I sought out a background in statistics after seeing too much gray area in information distribution. This ambiguity shows up in two forms.

There seems to be a general misunderstanding that science can tell data what to say. I've been asked several times in my life,*"Make the data do [xyz]."* or similarly, *"Have the data show..."* 

Whoa.[^1]  Slow down. One of my favorite things about statistics is the notion that a single dataset can tell many different stories by simply manipulating how the data are accessed and modeled. This fact, however, can and will be problematic.

That ambiguity is what moves statistics away from pure mathematics and into the middle ground between art and science.  It's this middle ground that fascinates me. Art and science are naturally complementary. Darwin wouldn't have made half the impact on the European World if he didn't return with his  beautifully detailed notes and sketches in Voyages on the Beagle.[^2] The same goes for da Vinci, a phenomenal artist and inventor to say the least. Better known for his paintings, his anatomical drawings were a hundred years ahead of their time[^3], and 350 years before Henry Gray. [^4]

Is it too cliché to name some of the biggest names? Probably. But I they highlight the point I want to make so effectively. Your presentation of data is useless if your audience can't digest it. These names stick with us because their information was presented beautifully. Darwin, da Vinci, and Gray were undeniably brilliant scientists, yet it was their ability to connect with laymen that made their work so influential.

###  Plain Language Statistics

Simple mistakes and malicious manipulation alike can alter data into something unrecognizable. Having the tools to call out those transgressions is the first step, whereas my focus comes in teaching folks to see the issues in data visualization and manipulation for themselves.
