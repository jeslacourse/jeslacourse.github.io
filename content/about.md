>If quarantine has brought me one gift, my once three-hour commute is now three hours each day to build a portfolio and digress on some of the more interesting topics in statistics, machine learning, and computer science. This of course, comes at the expense of turning the dining room into my new office but the familial repercussions appear to be relatively minor. 

Hi, I'm `[object Object]`. 

Kidding. My name is Jessica LaCourse and my primary background is in Statistics and Data Science. In the office, my focus is on student equity through the use of data. I also love integrating Geographic Information Systems (GIS) as a visual and analytic aid in my work. I've also held professional positions in Financial Accounting and Business Administration. Outside of professional work, my projects are oriented toward community action with emphasis on voter advocacy, community organization, and environmental awareness.

### Beautiful, Ethical Data

I'm fiercely dedicated to shedding light on community and environmental issues. I sought out a background in statistics after seeing too much gray area in information distribution. This ambiguity shows up in two forms: unethical data manipulation and poor visualization. 

There seems to be a general misunderstanding that science can tell data what to say. While working in finance, I can recall being asked,* "Make the data do [xyz]."* or similarly, *"Have the data show..."* 

Whoa. Slow down. One of my favorite things about statistics is the notion that a single dataset can tell many different stories by simply manipulating how the data are accessed and modeled. This fact, however, can and will be problematic. We as statisticians minimize ambiguity through transparency in our choice of practices. 

Ambiguity is also what moves statistics away from pure mathematics and into the an applied field borrowing from both art and science. Art and science are naturally complementary. Your presentation of data is useless if it lacks clarity. Simplifying visuals and creating some consistency are simple tactics to improve visualization. 

Simple mistakes and malicious manipulation alike can alter data into something unrecognizable. Having the tools and network to call out those transgressions is the first step, whereas my focus comes in teaching folks to see the issues in data visualization and manipulation for themselves. 

###  Plain-Language Statistics

Similar to visualization, there's a lot of power in simplifying statistical language to meet your audience at their level of understanding. It's a facinating process to watch faculty reach an "aha"-moment with their own information through Q&A discussions. Similarly, teaching young students the fundamentals of object-oriented programming has given me the opportunity to assess how well *I* know the fundamentals myself. With both parties, I'm learning as much from them as they are from me. 

### Out of Office

We're certainly living with a new normal. I've been lucky enough in the past several years be able to dedicate my time out of the office to exploring many of our National Parks and other public lands. It's amazing how much you can see and do in two weeks, I promise you! My profile photo was taken on the rim of a cinder cone volcano in Lassen National Park. The photo used for my GitHub account was a candid taken while shooting Mt. St. Helens at Sunset. 

If I'm not in the state, I'm likely out exploring what the rest of the West has to offer. I'm looking forward to more days out of the house, out of the office, and in the backcountry.
