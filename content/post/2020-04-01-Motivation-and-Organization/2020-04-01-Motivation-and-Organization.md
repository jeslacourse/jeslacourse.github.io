I'm excited. It's been a long road trying to find the right platform to build on. Fortunately, hosting on GitHub Pages, along with the incredible development of the Jekyll-based Minimal Mistakes theme has made web-development a (relatively) seamless task for integrating my projects from GitHub. I'll post source code and repositories as reasonable. Some of the projects are University-based and don't change much year-to-year. In those cases, sorry kids. Check out the end result but we can't make it that easy for you. 

The last ten or so years have been filled with amazing experiences and collaborations. Why not showcase my work and make it easier to collaborate with those that share my interests? My projects get pretty diverse: spatial models and highly detailed analytical maps, integration of bioinformation and APIs, and sociological studies are the first to come to mind.  And while the ability to show off some diversity is great, it's just a jumbled mess if it's not well organized. 


This site will help organize those thoughts and projects. Blog posts, much like this one, will be rare and the presentation of projects and information will take center stage. Already in the works is  a series on plain-language statistics and the conversion of existing projects into a more web-friendly format. Projects and posts will have searchable tags at the bottom of each page, which should allow you to find related materials. I'll leave a small number of static pages at the top of each page with some of my background information as well.
